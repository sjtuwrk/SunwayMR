Dear readers,

   Because SunwayMR project is not inspected by meac-skl inistitution, the code should not be public in whole.
   
   Now, some of it is public. 

   If you want read the code in whole which you want, please contact me, my email is sjtuwrk@sjtu.edu.cn. Thanks very much.

   The newest version code will come soon! After the SunwayMR project is not inspected, it will be opened in whole.
                 
                                                                
                                                                
                                                                              Yours,
