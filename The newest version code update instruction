Dear readers,

   Because SunwayMR project is not inspected by meac-skl inistitution, the code should not be public in whole.
   
   Now, some of it is public. 

   If you want to read the code in whole you want, please contact me, my email is sjtuwrk@sjtu.edu.cn. Thanks very much.

   The newest version code will come soon! After the SunwayMR project is inspected, it will be opened in whole.
                 
                                                                
                                                                
                                                                              Yours,
                                                                              Sunway Project Group
